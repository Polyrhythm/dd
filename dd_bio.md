# Backstory

## Kim
Kim was born to a middle class family in Singapore. Fascinated with overseas media from a young age, she knew that living abroad would be in her future. In grade school she was reserved, preferring to lose herself in the eclectic and obscure - zines, weird bands, cult movies.

 Kim`s parents were strict and had ambitions of the prototypical successful career for their daughter.

Kim didn`t have a ton of friends in school, but did have a best friend, Lin, who together with Kim explored the underworld of esoteric overseas pop culture.

By high school, Kim noticed that she was not into anything even remotely close to her peers. Boys weren`t in the picture. Her parents did not seem particularly aggressive on this front, rather being satisfied that their daughter seemed to be doing well enough in school.

A large conflict occurred in junior year of high school when Kim informed her parents of her desire to go to university in the US. Particularly in LA. To study literature. Secretly, she wanted to be a music critic, but failing that, she figured she might as well read a lot of books. Her favorite bands were all in the LA area and she built up a quasi-mythos of the area in her mind. It seemed a different world than the cloistered homogeneity, and global irrelevance, of Singapore. She ended up going to UCLA.

Her parents were not happy, to say the least. They threatened to not help pay for school, which indeed they followed through on...at first. By Kim`s sophomore year, she gave in and offered to, either begrudgingly or in respect of her stubbornness, pay partially for tuition.

In college, she met one Sam W., a film studies major, who happened to have a lot of overlap with her classes in English literature for underclassmen electives. Sam was...different. Unlike anything she had seen in Singapore. Utterly self-confident, seemingly devoid of insecurity, while somehow simultaneously holding immense knowledge of topics near and dear to Kim`s heart: pop culture esotera. You name it - they bonded over it: bands, books, films, poetry.

What's more, Kim felt things with Sam that she couldn't put into words - things that nobody else had made her feel. It went beyond mere friendship. Of course, Sam was more cognizant of this than Kim was.

## Sam
Sam the wildchild. Daughter to an unusual pairing of a artist father and engineer mother. It didn't go as ass-backwards as Mom teaching her how to throw a baseball, but Dad was definitely the emotionally-sensitive one. Sam learned early the value of forging your own path in life, of being comfortable in your own skin.

In school, she oscillated between a gender-neutral kid, to oscillating a bit far in the prom queen side of things by the confused teenage years. Perhaps as part of some kind of internal re-balancing. In any case, her string of short-lived affairs with the utterly boring athletes led her to snapping all the way over to another kind of super tomboy persona halfway through her junior year in high school. An interest in film kept her grounded. She fucking worshipped Rocky Horror Picture Show but her tastes spanned the genres, as anybody's would, and was not too ashamed to also like popular movies of the time.

For Sam, there was always an element of being slightly bored with the majority of people she came into contact with. Nobody seemed to have the self-confidence to really be themselves, to like what they really wanted to like. Growing up in a mid-sized, half rural, half suburban town that her parents loved for simplicity and nature, had seemed to her to be an unstimulating place. Unsatisfying for somebody craving to explore all walks of life.

Sam's parents were very supportive of her desire to study film at UCLA. Her dad, in particular, nodded with a kind of quiet understanding when they discussed it. He had been there at one point in his life, perhaps.

Sam's first sexual experience with a girl happened early senior year in high school. At one of those parties where people are standing around some classmate's family's vacant summer home, smoking cigarettes, talking about stupid shit, trying to be cool. She was talking with Laura, kind of a stuck-up bitch. Well, she thought so, anyway, until, in fact, she wasn't. She was cool. And they're talking. And the crappy music is coming out of a boombox on it's last legs. Dollar store christmas lights are blowing out behind her. Pabst Blue Ribbon. Sam's tomboy act felt shallow somehow, compared to Laura's depth. The conversation slowly got weirder, and Sam felt herself getting pulled in, inexorably. Sam was always so confident, but Laura seemed to have this crazy inner core of a person that was even denser than hers. It was a good night. It didn't last after that night, actually - they still lived in separate universes, but for that night, well, their worlds did come together. Sam took that experience with her.

By the end of senior year, Sam was starting to center. No longer the budding prom queen, but also not the complete counter-culture tomboy-lite she briefly mimicked. She was...well, Sam.

Her freshman year in UCLA was everything she hoped it would be. She met Kim her sophomore year. Both attending a book club, she noticed this girl who seeme to know her shit about, huh, Bukowski, huh...

Well gee whiz, who the fuck is this? Let's hang out.

And so they did.

## Kim and Sam
Kim and Sam? Sam and Kim? Hmm.

You know how this goes. Girl meets girl kinda thing.
Sam shows Kim some stuff. Blows her mind. As you do.
